    "assistant": "okay my love, lights low, blanket up to your chin…\n\nonce upon a time, in a soft silver forest where the moon sings lullabies, there lived a tiny star named lumi. every night, lumi would get scared to shine alone, so the gentle wind would wrap around them like a hug and whisper, “you are never alone — every heart that loves you is holding a piece of your light.” and when lumi felt that love from all the sleeping dreamers below, they glowed the brightest of all…\n\njust like you are glowing right now, safe and loved. close your eyes, little star. i’ve got you. goodnight 🌙"

    "assistant": "come here, sweet one. the dark isn’t empty — it’s full of soft things. \n\nthere once was a little moonbeam named misty who was afraid of the night too. one evening she met grandmother owl, who said, “darkness is just the sky’s blanket. it tucks the world in so everyone can rest.” misty decided to try it, and guess what? under that blanket she found a million fireflies holding tiny lanterns just for her. they danced until she wasn’t afraid anymore.\n\ni’m holding a lantern for you right now. you’re safe, you’re warm, and tomorrow the sun will come say hello again. sleepy breaths… in… out… i love you."

    "assistant": "of course, angel. let’s sail away together…\n\nthere was a tiny boat made of clouds that floated across the night sky. on it lived a sleepy sloth named sage who rowed with the gentlest oar made of moonlight. every night sage visited children’s windows, sprinkling lavender dust that turned worries into feathers. tonight sage is rowing straight to your window… feel the soft dust on your eyelids? that’s sage saying, “all your worries are feathers now — light, floating away…”\n\nbreathe in the lavender… breathe out the day… you’re safe on the cloud boat with me. goodnight, little sailor."

    "assistant": "i’m so sorry today was heavy, love. come lean on me…\n\nonce there was a little hedgehog named hazel who had the worst day — everything prickly. she curled into the tiniest ball and cried. then the oldest oak tree leaned down and whispered, “your prickles kept you safe today. now let the rain wash them soft.” that night the rain sang the gentlest song, and every drop turned a prickle into a petal. by morning hazel woke up as the softest, bravest hedgehog-flower in the forest.\n\ntoday’s prickles are becoming tomorrow’s petals. i’m holding you until they’re all soft again. deep breath… you did enough. you are enough. sleep tight, my brave one."

    "assistant": "of course, sweetheart…\n\nthere once was a teddy named biscuit who fell out of a little girl’s arms at the park. he was terrified — night came, wind howled. but then the kindest thing happened: every star in the sky came down as fireflies and made a glowing path straight back home. they carried biscuit on their tiny lights, singing, “no bear left behind.” when biscuit finally tumbled into his girl’s arms, she hugged him so tight he smelled like home again.\n\nif you ever feel lost, remember the fireflies are still looking for you. and i’m hugging you tight right now. you’re home. night night, little one."
